DATASET_HEATMAP
#In heatmaps, each ID is associated to multiple numeric values, which are displayed as a set of colored boxes defined by a color gradient
#lines starting with a hash are comments and ignored during parsing

#                    OPTIONAL SETTINGS                            #
#=================================================================#


#Heatmaps can have an optional Newick formatted tree assigned. Its leaf IDs must exactly match the dataset FIELD_LABELS.
#The tree will be used to sort the dataset fields, and will be displayed above the dataset. It can have branch lengths defined.
#All newlines and spaces should be stripped from the tree, and COMMA cannot be used as the dataset separator if a FIELD_TREE is provided.
#FIELD_TREE (((f1:0.2,f5:0.5):1,(f2:0.2,f3:0.3):1.2):0.5,(f4:0.1,f6:0.5):0.8):1;

#each dataset can have a legend, which is defined below
#for each row in the legend, there should be one shape, color and label
#shape should be a number between 1 and 6:
#1: square
#2: circle
#3: star
#4: right pointing triangle
#5: left pointing triangle
#6: checkmark

#LEGEND_TITLE,Dataset legend
#LEGEND_SHAPES,1,2,3
#LEGEND_COLORS,#ff0000,#00ff00,#0000ff
#LEGEND_LABELS,value1,value2,value3

#=================================================================#
#     all other optional settings can be set or changed later     #
#           in the web interface (under 'Datasets' tab)           #

#left margin, used to increase/decrease the spacing to the next dataset. Can be negative, causing datasets to overlap.
#MARGIN 0

#width of the individual boxes
STRIP_WIDTH,75

#always show internal values; if set, values associated to internal nodes will be displayed even if these nodes are not collapsed. It could cause overlapping in the dataset display.
#SHOW_INTERNAL 0

#if a FIELD_TREE is present, it can be hidden by setting this option to 0
#SHOW_TREE 1

#define the color for the NULL values in the dataset. Use the letter X in the data to define the NULL values
COLOR_NAN,#ffffff

#automatically create and display a legend based on the color gradients and values defined below
AUTO_LEGEND,1

#define the heatmap gradient colors. Values in the dataset will be mapped onto the corresponding color gradient.
COLOR_MIN,#daf5ff
COLOR_MAX,#00688B

#you can specify a gradient with three colors (e.g red to yellow to green) by setting 'USE_MID_COLOR' to 1, and specifying the midpoint color
#USE_MID_COLOR 1
#COLOR_MID #ffff00

#By default, color gradients will be calculated based on dataset values. You can force different values to use in the calculation by setting the values below:
#USER_MIN_VALUE 0
#USER_MID_VALUE 500
#USER_MAX_VALUE 1000

#Internal tree nodes can be specified using IDs directly, or using the 'last common ancestor' method described in iTOL help pages
